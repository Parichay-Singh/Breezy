We at Breeze, provide simple measures to mitigate the problem if the severity is low. If we detect high severity, we advise the users to not self-medicate and seek help from a professional psychiatrist or psychologist. 

## Inspiration 💭

&emsp; &emsp; With the recent advent of the pandemic and the lockdown it has brought, people have turned a blind eye towards their mental health. Living in isolation and having minimal to no contact with their loved ones certainly takes a toll on one’s health.

So, in order to keep our mental health in check, we turn towards certain mental health apps. While they perform pretty accurately to provide a prognosis based on user’s symptoms, users still have to select which diseases’ questionnaire they want to attempt. This would be problematic for a newbie as all the symptoms and all these questionnaires tend to get confusing.

## What we offer? 🧠

 - Take up the quiz after logging in to get your prognosis done.
 - Track your day-to-day progress graphically.
 - Take the quiz again whenever you want.
 - Get daily task recommendations based on your prognosis. Complete them and gain credits.
 - Have symptom-related queries? BreezyBot got you covered.

## How does it work? ⚒

&emsp; &emsp; Our algorithm makes the questionnaire unique for every user. This works on the basis of users previous logged answer. The first five questions are common for every user and based on user’s answer to these, other questions are asked from the user to precisely detect the mental illness.
